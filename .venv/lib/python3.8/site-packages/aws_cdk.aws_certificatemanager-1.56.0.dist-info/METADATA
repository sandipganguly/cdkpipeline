This package provides Constructs for provisioning and referencing
certificates which can be used in CloudFront and ELB.

The following requests a certificate for a given domain:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cert = certmgr.Certificate(self, "Certificate",
    domain_name="example.com"
)
```

After requesting a certificate, you will need to prove that you own the
domain in question before the certificate will be granted. The CloudFormation
deployment will wait until this verification process has been completed.

Because of this wait time, when using manual validation methods, it's better
to provision your certificates either in a separate stack from your main
service, or provision them manually and import them into your CDK application.

### Email validation

Email-validated certificates (the default) are validated by receiving an
email on one of a number of predefined domains and following the instructions
in the email.

See [Validate with Email](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html)
in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.

### DNS validation

If Amazon Route 53 is your DNS provider for the requested domain, the DNS record can be
created automatically:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Certificate(self, "Certificate",
    domain_name="hello.example.com",
    validation=CertificateValidation.from_dns(my_hosted_zone)
)
```

Otherwise DNS records must be added manually and the stack will not complete
creating until the records are added.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Certificate(self, "Certificate",
    domain_name="hello.example.com",
    validation=CertificateValidation.from_dns()
)
```

See also [Validate with DNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html)
in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.

When working with multiple domains, use the `CertificateValidation.fromDnsMultiZone()`:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
example_com = route53.HostedZone(self, "ExampleCom",
    zone_name="example.com"
)

example_net = route53.HostedZone(self, "ExampelNet",
    zone_name="example.net"
)

cert = acm.Certificate(self, "Certificate",
    domain_name="test.example.com",
    subject_alternative_names=["cool.example.com", "test.example.net"],
    validation=acm.CertificateValidation.from_dns_multi_zone({
        "text.example.com": example_com,
        "cool.example.com": example_com,
        "test.example.net": example_net
    })
)
```

Use the `DnsValidatedCertificate` construct for cross-region certificate creation:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
DnsValidatedCertificate(self, "CrossRegionCertificate",
    domain_name="hello.example.com",
    hosted_zone=my_hosted_zone,
    region="us-east-1"
)
```

This is useful when deploying a stack in a region other than `us-east-1` with a
certificate for a CloudFront distribution.

If cross-region is not needed, the recommended solution is to use the
`Certificate` construct which uses a native CloudFormation implementation.

### Importing

If you want to import an existing certificate, you can do so from its ARN:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
arn = "arn:aws:..."
certificate = Certificate.from_certificate_arn(self, "Certificate", arn)
```

### Sharing between Stacks

To share the certificate between stacks in the same CDK application, simply
pass the `Certificate` object between the stacks.
